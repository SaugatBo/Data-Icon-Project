  <h1> Brownsville's Chronic Absenteeism is a societal problem </h1>
  <p id=byline> <i> By Saugat Bolakhe </i></p>

  <p> <b> When kids don't go for classes, often schools take the blame. But researchers say it may actually be a societal problem. </b> </p>

  <p> Among all the New York neighborhoods, the kids living around Brownsville of Northeast Brooklyn seem to miss the schools most. New York city Wellness index report published in 2019 indicate that nearly 47% of all the school kids of the locality miss 19 or more school days in a year.

Earlier this year, the neighborhood also got its new superintendent, Khalik Kirkland. In a welcome message addressed for the community, Kirkland puts up his vision for the school attendance. He says that the schools in the district will be so inviting “that our scholars will wake up each morning eager to get to school each and every day.” But for a neighborhood that has historically suffered from chronic absenteeism, could its turnaround be that straightforward? </p>

  <p> Researcher Cristie Granillo of Loma Linda University school of behavioral health has done extensive research on chronic absenteeism trends in low-income neighborhoods. And she points out that chronic absenteeism doesn’t have one root cause; “but it stems from several causes that are perpetuated by inadequate systems,” she says. So, a way to tackle this issue is to understand the cause of absenteeism. </p>

  <h4> Causes of Chronic Absenteeism: </h4>
</div>
  <p> <mark> <b> 1.	Sociodemographic Problem:</b></mark><br>
    Researchers point that Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) students have the highest rates of chronic absenteeism. And these communities are also the one who are mainly offered low paying jobs. In Brownsville recent reports indicate that crime rate, unemployment rate, COVID infection rate and mental distress issues are particularly high. These combinations of social issues seem to contribute heavily to kids’ well-being thus impacting attendance rate as well. </p>

 <p> <mark><b> 2.	Health Issues: </b></mark> <br>
   <div class="row col">

  One of the most common causes of school absenteeism seem to be health related issues. During the early pandemic years, COVID related infections were the prime cause for absenteeism. Researchers also say that condition like Asthma, and kids’ social behavioral health can also result in chronic absenteeism. </p>

<p><mark> <b> 3.	Family structure: </b> </mark><br>
<div class="row col">
  <div class="col-6" style="margin-left: 11vw;">
  Interestingly, family structure can also contribute to chronic absenteeism. When family size is smaller parents seemed to be engaged even more to manage the living. They get so busy to manage the rent, and groceries, and personal health that they may miss things like education and school attendance. “If I'm trying to keep the four walls of my house while trying to meet my basic needs, then school is not going to be my priority,” Granillo says. </p>
</div>
<div class="col-4" id="family">

  <p> Thus, the issue of kid’s school attendance shouldn’t be taken only as a school matter. In fact, solution should be directed towards fixing these social systems. Researchers say as a society, we should help school districts that serve complex populations so that it could empower parents and the families to get the resources they need so that it helps them to monitor their kids’ education and send them regularly for school. </p>
